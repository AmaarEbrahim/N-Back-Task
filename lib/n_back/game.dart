/// Having one Mode instance per mode in the game ensures that in each trial
/// a randomly selected value will be chosen and showed/played for every
/// mode.
/// 
/// **Usage**
/// 
/// Instantiate, and specify the type of the values that can be picked 
/// through the generic parameter
/// 
/// Call `next()` when you want the instance to select and store the next 
/// random value.
/// 
/// Use `mostRecentSession` when you want to signal that the user believes
/// that there is a match.
/// 
/// Call `generateStatistics()` when you want to see the matches/hits. 
/// 
/// **Design**
/// 
/// Mode keeps track of a list of choosable values in this.domain. 
/// this.domain is a list whose elements belong to the class's generic
/// parameter, DomainType. 
/// 
/// Everytime `next()` is called, a new `Session` instance is created. The 
/// session lets you signal whether the user thinks there is a match. Using
/// the `Session` class like this is a new pattern that I am testing. The
/// advantage to it is that it encapsulates all information into a class
/// whose properties are *defined*. The alternative to this pattern is to
/// keep the properties that would have been in the Session inside of this
/// class. However, since these properties would not be set when this class 
/// is instantiated, every one of them would be *possibly undefined*. With
/// this pattern, only the Session instance is possibly undefined. Every
/// property inside of it is defined.

      // 2 trials ago.

      // To get the item displayed N trials ago, we look into `this.history`.
      // If not enough trials have occurred, it is possible that there
      // does not exist an item N trials ago. For example, I could play
      // dual 2-back and say there is a match on the first trial. A Dual
      // 2-back match requires at least 3 trials, so it is impossible for there
      // to be a match on the first trial.
      // When this happens, there is an automatic miss.

      // index to look at in `this.history` through this equation
      //    index = history.length - n - 1

      // Ex: suppose we're playing 3-back, and it is trial 5. The trial number
      // should correspond to the size of history because at the start of
      // every trial a new item is added to history. So, the item to check 
      // would be at index = 5 - 3 - 1 = 1. 
      //
      // This may be unintuitive. Why isn't index = 2? You would think it 
      // should be 2 because 5 - 3 is 2. This is not the case because array
      // indices start at 0, so we subtract 1 to account for that. Here's a 
      // visual:
      //    history:
      //      index   0       1       2       3       4
      //      value   item1   item2   item3   item4   item5
      // The index to check for each n-back:
      //      1-BACK                            ^
      //      2-BACK                    ^

/// **Design Considerations**
/// A proposed way to design this class was to store the visual and/or audio
/// Mode instances in a list. Since this game supports either visual, audio,
/// or both modalities, customizing the behavior of the game would be as
/// simple as creating a list that had either a visual Mode, an audio Mode, 
/// or both. When the player believes there is a match, they would call
/// a single method and pass in something (e.g. an enum or instance) to 
/// indicate the mode their match was for. For example, if the player
/// believed there was a visual match, their call may look like this:
/// 
///     
///     Game2Instance.match(ModalityType.Visual)
///     
/// 
/// The method to advance to the next trial would behave by looping
/// through the list of Mode instances and calling the `advance` or equivalent 
/// method to advance the trial for each mode. **However**, while this
/// approach is simple and can eliminate a lot of redundancy, the problem
/// is that the Mode class is generic. Its generic parameter specifies the
/// domain of the Mode instance, or list of valid values that the mode can
/// choose and store in its history.
